 * Description : Reducer class that implements the reduce part of the Single-source shortest path algorithm. This class extends the SearchReducer class that implements 
 * parallel breadth-first search algorithm. 
 * The reduce method implements the super class' reduce method and increments the counter if the color of the node returned from the super class is GRAY.

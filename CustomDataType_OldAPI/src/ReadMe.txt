There can be use cases where none of the built-in data types matches the requirements or a custom data type 
optimized for a  use case may perform better than a Hadoop built-in data type. In such scenarios a custom 
Writable data type can be written by implementing the org.apache.hadoop.io.Writable interface to define the 
serialization format of your data type.

The Writable interface-based types can be used as value types in Hadoop MapReduce computations.

In this example, we implement a sample Hadoop Writable data type for HTTP server log
entries. For the purpose of this sample, we consider that a log entry consists of the five
fieldsâ€”request host, timestamp, request URL, response size, and the http status code.

The following is a sample log entry:
192.168.0.2 - - [01/Jul/1995:00:00:01 -0400] "GET /history/apollo/
HTTP/1.0" 200 6245
